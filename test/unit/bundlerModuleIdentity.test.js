/**
 * One file must be one module.
 *
 * A module's identity in the graph is the path the resolver returned. When two
 * specifiers reach the same file by different paths -- which is what a symlink
 * does, and what `npm link`, a `file:` dependency, a pnpm store and a workspace
 * all produce -- the bundler used to emit that file twice under two ids.
 *
 * Duplicated source is the visible half of that. The half that breaks
 * applications is state: a module holding a registry, a cache or a counter
 * becomes two registries, and a writer filling one is invisible to a reader
 * consulting the other. `lib/core/renderer/stringRenderer.js` is exactly such a
 * module, and splitting it is what made a component with an IR-refused template
 * render nothing at all.
