/**
 * Every construct that can force the fallback path must be covered somewhere.
 *
 * `RefusalReason` is the compiler's list of constructs the IR does not model.
 * Each one sends a component down the string renderer, and that path is the one
 * that rendered nothing without saying so. The three that were broken --
 * suspense, error boundaries and the deadlock boundary -- were also the three
 * the E2E suite listed as uncovered. The coverage gap and the defect were the
 * same fact.
 *
 * So the list is not allowed to grow quietly. Adding a refusal reason means
 * adding it below, with either the coverage that exercises it or an explicit
 * note saying why it has none. Either is fine; saying nothing is not.
 *
 * This test knows nothing about whether the coverage is good. It knows only
 * that a decision was recorded, which is the thing that was missing.
