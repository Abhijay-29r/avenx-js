 * @description The findings Atlas can safely derive from the model.
 *
 * Both diagnostics here are **absence** claims — "nothing reads this", "nothing
 * invokes this" — and an absence claim is only as good as the completeness of
 * the search behind it. Atlas knows exactly where its search was incomplete,
 * because it recorded every relationship it could not resolve, so each rule
 * checks that record before concluding anything.
 *
 * The rule this file exists to enforce: **a diagnostic must never conclude
 * "never read" from a body the analyser could not follow.** A false AVX_W40 on
 * a state key that is read through a computed member would teach a developer
 * to stop trusting the whole feature, which costs far more than the warnings
 * it suppresses.
