/**
 * Collects every expression-bearing construct in a template, with its offset.
 *
 * Two callers need exactly this walk and must not drift apart:
 * `validateTemplate` runs it over the processed template to report undeclared
 * references, and Atlas runs it over the original source — where the offsets
 * still point at what the developer wrote — to record the relationships each
 * construct creates.
 *
 * Offsets are relative to whatever string is passed in. Nothing here assumes
 * the template has been transformed, so it is safe on raw source.
 * @param {string} template - The template text to walk.
 * @returns {Array<object>} Events ordered by offset. Each carries `type`,
 *   `index` and `length`; expression-bearing types also carry `expr`.
